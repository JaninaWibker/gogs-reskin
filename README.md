# Gogs reskin

Gogs (open source git server solution) has a somewhat outdated web interface. This repo contains modifications that I personally use to:
- make gogs look better (inputs, header bar, ...)
- make it (somewhat) mobile friendly
- replace the logo with the default git logo

The files in this repository are ment to be a replacement for many of gogs own template files. Most modifications are done through css but some did require the html to be changed somewhat (for example to add extra css classes to hook onto). Instead of just committing the changed files every template file is committed here. This means that the templates folder can be replaced as a whole.
